<h1>iOS Coding Assignment</h1>
<p>This is a coding challenge for iOS developers.</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h2>All candidates</h2>
<p>Candidate <strong>must</strong> have git installed on their machine.</p>
<h2>Candidate on pre-Tahoe macOS</h2>
<p>Candidate must have Xcode 15.4+, and at least one iOS 15+ model iPhone emulator</p>
<h2>Candidate with Tahoe (macOS 26+)</h2>
<p>Candidate must have Xcode 26+, and at least one iOS 26+ model iPhone emulator</p>
<h1>Relax</h1>
<ul>
<li>We're more concerned with your thought process and how you approach the
problem than the final product.</li>
<li>Don't worry about the time. We are looking for a working app, not a
polished one.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Step 1</h1>
<p><strong>Fork</strong> this repository on GitHub and <strong>clone</strong> it.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>WeatherPlus</strong> project in Xcode.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the UI, you will use SwiftUI</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">Model-View-ViewModel</a>
(MVVM) pattern. Bonus points for also using the Coordinator pattern.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Step 2</h1>
<p>Use the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather API</a> to fetch weather
details. Here is an example call requesting the hourly temperature and rainfall
for the lat/long of New York City, NY. Below is an example query you will use. You must
update the latitude and longitude values in the URL to match the listed cities.</p>
<p><code>https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=40.71&amp;longitude=-74.01&amp;hourly=temperature_2m,rain</code></p>
<p>Note: You can use the above query's response to create your data model.</p>
<p>Please use the latitude and longitude of the following cities to fetch
temperature and rainfall conditions for every hour of the day. A day is
considered to run from 00:00:00 through 23:59:59. Hours should be displayed in
the app according to the device's time display option.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>City</th>
<th>Lat</th>
<th>Long</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>New York</td>
<td>40.71</td>
<td>-74.01</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dallas</td>
<td>32.78</td>
<td>-96.81</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Miami</td>
<td>25.77</td>
<td>-80.19</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Use the images included in the <code>assets</code> folder (in the root directory of your
local clone) for a visual indicator of the weather conditions. There are three
images for each asset. Talk us through why you choose a particular type.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Precipitation</th>
<th>Weather Condition</th>
<th>Image</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.0</td>
<td>Sunny</td>
<td><img src="assets/sunny.png" alt="sunny"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.0 &lt; x &lt; 1.0</td>
<td>Light Rain</td>
<td><img src="assets/light-rain.png" alt="light rain"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x &gt;= 1.0</td>
<td>Heavy Rain</td>
<td><img src="assets/heavy-rain.png" alt="heavy rain"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here is a rough design for the sample app...</p>

<h1>Expected funtionality in descending order of importance</h1>
<ol>
<li>Fetch the current temperature for the three cities and list their current
temperature, along with a rain or sun symbol as appropriate.</li>
<li>Clicking on a city row will display the full weather report of that city
for each hour of the day</li>
<li>A control at the top of the main screen that switches between
Celsius and Fahrenheit. This control can be any type you choose.</li>
<li>The temperature system selected in view 1 should be carried to view 2.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Clean, readable code</li>
<li>Knowledge of MVVM, delegation, UI and navigation, fetching and parsing JSON
data, git.</li>
</ul>
